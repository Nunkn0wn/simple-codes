        <p>
          <strong>Itachi Uchiha</strong> is considered a good character in the
          Naruto show for several reasons. One of the main reasons is his
          complex and tragic backstory, which is revealed gradually throughout
          the series. Itachi's past, including his childhood and his role in the
          Uchiha clan massacre, makes him a multi-dimensional character that
          viewers can sympathize with. Itachi's loyalty to his village and his
          dedication to protecting it at all costs, even if it means making
          personal sacrifices, is admirable. His actions, including his
          involvement in the Uchiha clan massacre, are controversial, but they
          are rooted in a desire to prevent a civil war that would have
          devastated the village. Finally, Itachi's interactions with other
          characters in the show, particularly his brother Sasuke, add depth to
          his character and create emotional moments that resonate with viewers.
          <strong>
            <em>
              All these factors make Itachi Uchiha a well-written and compelling
              character in the Naruto show.</em
